			"details": "Deprecated. This contract is kept in the Upgrades Plugins for backwards compatibility purposes. Users should use openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol instead. Helper contract to support initializer functions. To use it, replace the constructor with a function that has the `initializer` modifier. WARNING: Unlike constructors, initializer functions must be manually invoked. This applies both to deploying an Initializable contract, as well as extending an Initializable contract via inheritance. WARNING: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or ensure that all initializers are idempotent, because this is not dealt with automatically as with constructors.",
